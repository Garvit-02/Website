      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence
        and Machine Learning with a strong focus on backend development. I have
        solved 170+ Data Structures & Algorithms problems and built multiple
        full-stack MERN applications involving secure authentication, role-based
        access control, database optimization, and payment systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy designing clean backend architectures, building reliable REST
        APIs, and writing maintainable code that scales. I am actively seeking
        Software Development Engineer or Backend Intern opportunities.
